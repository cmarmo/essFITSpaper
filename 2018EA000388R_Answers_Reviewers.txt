Reviewer 2

We want to thank the anonymous reviewer for his thoughtful comments.
Sections 2.1 and 3 have been enriched following his suggestions.

> 1. The FITS tool ecosystem - FITS has been around for a long time, and has a

Section 2.1 has been expanded (see paragraph starting at L68 in trackchanges.pdf),
references to available tools have been added in footnotes.

A small introduction to Section 3 has been added, in particular clarifying, we hope,
the choice of the described tools.

Section 2.1 has been expanded (see paragraph starting at L86 in trackchanges.pdf).
We hope this syntetic answer will be enough to clarify our point of view.
A more detailed discussion have been omitted due to overall length.

> 4. Editorial comment - the paper is heavy on acronyms, some of which are not spelled

> All acronyms should be spelled out, and/or a table of acronyms should be added.

Fixed.
